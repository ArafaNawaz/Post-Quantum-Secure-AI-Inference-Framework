# Post-Quantum Secure AI Inference Framework

## Project Overview
This framework implements a quantum-resistant AI inference pipeline using CRYSTALS-Kyber and NTRU encryption to ensure model integrity in post-quantum environments.

###  Features
- Quantum-Resistant Inference: Uses CRYSTALS-Kyber and NTRU encryption for robust protection.
- Model Integrity Assurance: Prevents tampering and maintains secure inference in post-quantum contexts.
- Secure Model Deployment: Ensures models remain secure during deployment.

###  Technologies
- Encryption: CRYSTALS-Kyber, NTRU
- Backend: Python
- Deployment: Streamlit
- Testing: Pytest

###  Getting Started
